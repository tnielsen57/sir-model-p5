# SIR Model built with p5.js
Visualization of a simple SIR model using p5, a little experiment of mine while the world is dealing with Covid-19. 

This is by no means a scientifically accurate model, it should just illustrate the effect of certain parameters on the infection rate of a disease.
All data used is either made up by me or randomized and does not relate to any real world scenario.
